  <h3>History</h3>
  <p><b>Matthew Hauri</b>, otherwise known as <b>Yung Gravy</b>, was born in Rochester, Minnesota in 1996. While attending college in Madison, Wisconsin, he began rapping at parties and other low-key social events. In 2016, he quit his job and spent months self-recording songs, uploading his first song, "Karen," which attracted a quick online buzz.  His first EP, Mr. Clean, was released later that year. The doo wop samples and trap rhythms of his song <i>Mr. Clean</i> inspired multiple fan videos, some of which went viral. He followed up with his own video for the song in October of 2017 and it went viral as well, racking up millions of views in a few months. That year saw plenty of new music from Yung Gravy, including three EPs -- Thanksgiving's Eve, Yung Gravity, and Baby Gravy. He began 2018 with the release of the single "1 Thot 2 Thot Red Thot Blue Thot," a song with his increasingly signature lyrics and beats built on retro-sourced samples. His fame grew, and early tours resulted in sold-out shows and legions of new fans. </p>
  
  <p>After signing with Republic, Yung Gravy made his major-label debut with the Snow Couger EP then rounded out his banner year by teaming up with Atlanta-based rapper Lil Baby for the single "Alley Oop." Led by the single "Magic," his Republic-issued full-length debut, Sensational arrived in May 2019.</p>
